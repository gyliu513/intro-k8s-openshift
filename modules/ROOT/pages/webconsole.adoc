= Web Console
While the command line tool is awesome, for this course we are going to focus on the web console, which is equally awesome.

== Projects

For the workshop we will use the following pre-created projects:

=== Istio Tutorial 

`tutorial{namespace-suffix}` will be used to perform all the servicemesh tasks.

=== Knative Tutorial

`{tutorial-namespace}` will be used to perform all the serverless tasks.

We'll get into those in future sections, but go ahead and explore to see what's possible! Don't spend too much time on these now as you will get to use a lot of these features in the upcoming sections.
