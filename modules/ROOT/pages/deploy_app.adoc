== Deploy your first application
:experimental:

In this section you will be deploying simple REST API called `greeter`. This application has simple REST URL that returns **Hi**.

Navigate to `tutorial-pass:[$WORKSHOP_USER]` from the list of projects. Switch to "Developer mode"

==  Deploy Greeter

The simplest way to deploy an application in OpenShift is to take an existing Docker-formatted image and run it. We are going to use the OpenShift web console to do this, so ensure you have the OpenShift web console open and that you are in the project called `tutorial{namespace-suffix}`.

The OpenShift web console provides various options to deploy an application to a project. For this section, we are going to use the *Deploy Image* method.

As the project is empty at this point, select menu:[Add] from sidebar navigation and choose the *Container Image* button.

These are all the steps you need to run to get a "vanilla" Docker-formatted image deployed on OpenShift. This should work with any Docker-formatted image that follows best practices, such as defining the port any service is exposed on, not needing to run specifically as the *root user* or other dedicated user, and which embeds a default command for running the application. For this example we will use the docker image `quay.io/rhdevelopers/knative-tutorial-greeter:quarkus`

[IMPORTANT]
====
Click the magnifying lens next to image name to verify and validate the container image that has been entered. Only on successful validation you will be able to proceed further in configuring the application.
====

After entering the application name as `greeter` click the deploy button to get the deployment started.

A successful application deployment will show the `greeter` app in the project

You can also navigate to the menu:Workloads[Pods] using the sidebar navigation to see the list of pods

Congratulations! You have deployed your first OpenShift Application. In upcoming sections we will see how to scale your application and make application service accessible.
